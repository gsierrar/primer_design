# primer_design
This is a repository for a really quick design of gene primers for qPCR and RTQPCR to target genes important for the acylsugar pathway

I used Primer_blast (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/index.cgi?GROUP_TARGET=on) with the next parameters:
-PCR size product: 600 to 800
-Tm min: 59, opt: 60, max: 63
-Specifity checking parameters: 
--Database: Refseq representative genome
--Organism: Solanaceae (taxid:4070)

To check secondary structures and pick the best pair of primers please go to: https://www.idtdna.com/pages/tools/oligoanalyzer?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=00588_1i_03&utm_content=search&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA74G9BhAEEiwA8kNfpZbInSuWbY_O1vC4pg84hpm5bFKcDKPT9l5UaYYF0SrVw3IBidAzuRoCeMMQAvD_BwE#get-started. You need to register, but otherwise is free. 

The pdf included in the repository talks about the best practices for qPCR primers. Check it out, please.
